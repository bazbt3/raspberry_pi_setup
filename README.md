# Raspberry Pi setup

Setting up a Raspberry Pi 2 computer isn't as trivial a task as the world would have you believe.  Nevertheless it's not difficult, just time-consuming and occasionally frustrating.  It depends what you wish to **do.**  As someone with limited Linux knowledge it's an interesting challenge for me.

## What?

Despite the repo's name, this isn't about setting up a Raspberry Pi 2, it's about setting it up to achieve a very specific goal.  My Pi will be used to copy my blog repo from GitHub on a regular basis, build it locally, then FTP the site files to my web host.

## Why?

Good question.  Because I paid for the web host I may as well use the space for something other than the obsolete Wiki there now.  And because I can and wish to.  Everyone needs a hobby!

It's an interesting ride.
